ðŸ˜† *What is your favourite Repository on GitHub?*

Here is a list to help you find some interesting, significant and maybe *cute* projects. 

The reasons why I choose these repositories are not only their âœ¨high starsðŸ’« but also meaningful to me, who is a beginner in Computer Science. I hope it could be beneficial to you as well.
